### Getting Started

- Install the program
- Create a new project
- Enter username and password
- Select an empty folder for synchronization
- Click continue

### Synchronization

- Synchronization starts automatically if more than an hour has passed since the last synchronization

- Synchronization can be forced by clicking "Synchronize" from the context menu

- Conflicts must be resolved manually. The program is intended for note synchronization, so it won't be a problem to keep the text you consider more correct.

## Repository Deletion

- Select "Delete" from the context menu
- When deleting, it's important to understand that only the local copy will be deleted, the server copy will remain and you can restore it at any time
- Before deletion, it's recommended to synchronize your local version with the server version
