## Why closed testing is needed?

Closed testing is needed for Android apps to gather feedback from a select group of trusted users, identify bugs, and ensure the app complies with Google Play policies before a wider release. It is also a mandatory step for new personal developer accounts to gain production access. 

### Key reasons for closed testing

- User feedback and bug detection: Allows you to get specific feedback from a controlled group of testers before exposing the app to the public. Testers can report issues without impacting your app's public ratings.
- Policy compliance: Helps ensure your app meets Google Play's policies before being made available to billions of users.
- Production access requirement: For newly created personal developer accounts, running a closed test with a minimum number of testers is a mandatory requirement before you can publish the app to production.
- Targeted testing: You can target specific users, such as those in certain regions, to gather relevant feedback and run controlled experiments in parallel using different testing tracks.
- Pre-release stabilization: You can use closed testing to stabilize the app and fix issues in a more private setting before a potential public (open) beta test or full launch.
