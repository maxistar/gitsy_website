> I have an iPhone. Can I use the app?

– No, the app is only available for Android.

> I have Windows. Can I use the app?

– No, but you can use the desktop client. There are many examples online showing how to do this.

> Can I sync notes across devices on different platforms?

– Yes, of course! But Gitsy only works on Android.

> Does the app have access to data from other apps on the device?

– No, that's not possible. Because of this, you have to copy data between storages manually, but the app doesn't require access to all files on your device.
