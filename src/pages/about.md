— This is an Android app that allows you to synchronize files between a mobile phone and a remote Git repository.

## Why was it created?

The developer couldn’t find a tool that suited his personal needs, so he made his own. For a long time, he used Termux in combination with Termux-Widgets, but this solution turned out to be difficult to set up for new projects. With this custom app, the task becomes much simpler.

### How does the app work?
— The app functions as a Git client.

## Contact the developer
— I would be happy to receive your feedback about the app.

## Blog

— The blog publishes up-to-date information about the app and its features.
